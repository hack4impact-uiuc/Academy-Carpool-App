# academy-carpool-app
Welcome to H4I Academy Fall 2019, the Pilot semester for the Academy team.  
The Carpool App is the project to bring together everything that the members of Academy have learned this semester. It is simpler than a full fledged H4I project seeing as we only have had about half the time to complete it, but it still has a level of difficulty that will keep the members on their toes!  
There are also many add-ons that can be reached with this project, including but not limited to Authentication.
